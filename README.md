## About Mitron Bank [游대Home](#table-of-content)

Mitron Bank is a legacy financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad. They want to introduce a new line of credit cards, aiming to broaden their product offerings and reach in the financial market.

## Objective of the Project [游대Home](#table-of-content)

The objective is to analyze the data and provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to guide Mitron Bank in tailoring the new credit cards to customer needs and market trends.

## Problem Statement [游대Home](#table-of-content)

### Demographic Classification:
Classify the customers based on available demographics such as age group, gender, occupation, etc., and provide insights based on them.


### Average Income Utilization %:
Find the average income utilization % of customers (avg_spends/avg_income). This will be your key metric. The higher the average income utilization %, the more likely they are to use credit cards.

### Spending Insights:
Where do people spend money the most? Does it have any impact due to occupation, gender, city, age, etc.? This can help you add relevant credit card features for specific target groups.

### Key Customer Segments:
Identify and profile key customer segments likely to be the highest-value users of the new credit cards. This includes understanding their demographics, spending behaviors, and financial preferences.

### Credit Card Feature Recommendations:
Provide recommendations on key features to include in the credit card to improve the likelihood of credit card usage. This should be backed by data insights and secondary research.

## Demographic Classification [游대Home](#table-of-content)
